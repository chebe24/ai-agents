## v1.3 — Next Track (Planned)

### FilingAgent Hub (v2.0 centerpiece)
A personal filing assistant that keeps files named correctly, organized in the right
folders, and maintains active/archive status. Based on hub architecture research
saved at `scripts/agent-hub-research.md`.

Planned worker Agents:
- **NamingAgent** — validates and corrects filenames against FLAIM convention
- **OrganizerAgent** — routes files to correct Drive folders by subject/type
- **ArchiveAgent** — flags and moves old or completed files
- **RecordsAgent** — maintains tracking sheet log of all file actions

Router.gs will act as the supervisor, chaining workers as needed.

### Other v1.2 Items
- [ ] CI/CD with GitHub Actions — auto-deploy on push to main
- [ ] Set DRIVE_FOLDER_ID Script Property in prod, run updateInventory()
- [ ] RelocationTracker — wire into FilingAgent as a context ("relocation")

---

## v2.0 (Future)
- FilingAgent Hub fully operational
- Auto-archive after 90 days
- Dashboard for agent status
- Multi-trigger support (time-based + webhook)
- HSK vocabulary drill Agent (Shanghai prep)

## Ideas Backlog
